# pathfinding-visualizer
A simple pathfinding algorithm visualizer (with a maze generator) written in Python.

## Requirements
This project requires `Python >=3.10.4` and `Pygame >=2.1.2`.

## Getting started
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kappq/pathfinding-visualizer.git
```
Move into the just created directory:
```
cd pathfinding-visualizer
```
Run the code:
```
python main.py
```

## Usage
Press `M` to start the maze generation algorithm and press `P` to start the path finding algorithm. If you want to change the dimension of the maze or any of the algorithms, you will have to edit the `main.py` file.
